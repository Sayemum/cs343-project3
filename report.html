<!-- REPORT
    1. My app is called "Video Game Profile and News" and it's purpose is to be able to search up a video game title and return a bunch of information
        about the video game. By combining the "RAWG Video Games Database" and "Web Search" APIs, I'm able to extract information about the game into a profile
        using RAWG, while also using Web Search to search for 5 news sources online onto the page as well. This is meant to be a reliable app to gain
        quick information on a particular video game and be up to date on any recent news on the internet that has been created for the game.
    2. My app satisfies the assignment's requirements by first being deployed using Github.io. It uses media queries in main.css for when the user is either
        on mobile or on a screen size big enough for something like a desktop. It uses two already existing APIs (RAWG Video Games Database & Web Search) to
        create functionality. It has a search bar to be able to search for a specific video game. After searching, the site does display results according
        to the video game that was typed in the search box. Finally, the news results are filterable either alphabetically, by publish date, or by the provider.
